# 🪙Conclusion & how to improve:
1. need to address why the llm selector is important
	1. when GPT4 is cheap, why need this, 
		1. money wise
		2. show gpt4 cannot solve everything
	2. is AI agent truly can use this ?
	3. what else it could be used on, beside just picking model with best performance or cost efficient 
2. need to consider about the prompt
	1. I need to prove that there is a limit of prompt engineering, and how 
	2. my naive research thought only considering about model's ability, but after picked a different model, select/modify a prompt that fits the selected model 
3. have some experiment result on the classification and database build a prototype.
