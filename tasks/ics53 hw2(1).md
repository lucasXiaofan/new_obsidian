# 🎢Log:

# 😅Questions:
- [ ] something super weird happend -u -p 5 will make level arg to 0 while -u 0 -p 5 will not change the level arg, I am thinking the optarg was overwrite
# 🧑‍💻TODOs:
- [x] need to solve the problem with copy str with some edge cases ✅ 2024-04-24
- [ ] solve the memory leak problem 
	- [ ] need to check all malloc, I call it too much time, need make sure the memory are all released 
- [ ] handle the edge case invalid argument like U without number by initialize the optarg 
- [ ] discuss my result with edward, and try his test cases?

| error in F | the return is sorted in alpha not total count |     |

# 🪙Conclusion & how to improve:
1. before write code make sure I understand which function should responsible for free the memory 
	1. create more lending helper function
